That is so fundamentally important that the  discussion between the magistrate and the prosecutor in the instant case warranted on its own,  without anything more, the setting aside of the sentence.  Had such a discussion occurred  before conviction in this matter there can be no question but that the conviction would have  been fatally irregular: S v Seedat 1971 (1) SA 789 (N) at 792F.”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 53 Reference was made to Telcordia above n 21 at para 86 which reads as follows: “Likewise, it is a fallacy to label a wrong interpretation of a contract, a wrong perception or  application of South African law, or an incorrect reliance on inadmissible evidence by the  arbitrator as a transgression of the limits of his power.  The power given to the arbitrator was  to interpret the agreement, rightly or wrongly; to determine the applicable law, rightly or  wrongly; and to determine what evidence was admissible, rightly or wrongly.  Errors of the  kind mentioned have nothing to do with him exceeding his powers; they are errors committed  within the scope of his mandate.  To illustrate, an arbitrator in a ‘normal’ local arbitration has  to apply South African law but if he errs in his understanding or application of local law the  parties have to live with it.  If such an error amounted to a transgression of his powers it  would mean that all errors of law are reviewable, which is absurd.”  (Footnote omitted.)

At page 5 of the decision the following statement appears: “There is no doubt that a voluntary waiver of court proceedings in favour of arbitration is in  principle acceptable from the point of view of Article 6 . . . Even so such a waiver should not  necessarily be considered to be a waiver of all rights under Article 6.” In the result, it was held, on the facts, that there had been an enforceable waiver of the right to challenge the  award on the basis of the alleged lack of impartiality of one of the arbitrators.
