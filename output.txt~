Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 43 The concept of marriage as a civil right has been advanced by some American courts in a variety of  circumstances, for example, Skinner v. Oklahoma 316 US 535, 541 (1942); Perez v. Lippold 198 P.2d 17, 20-1  (1948).  See also Loving v. Virginia 388 US 1 (1967), where Chief Justice Warren speaking for the majority of  the Supreme Court included language describing marriage as one of the basic civil rights of man.  See further Noonan, who in “The Family and the Supreme Court” (1973) 23 Catholic University Law Review  255 at 273 comments as follows on the Loving v. Virginia case:  “The vital personal right recognized by Loving v. Virginia is not the right to a piece of paper  issued by a city clerk.  It is not the right to exchange magical words before an agent authorized  by the state.  It is the right to be immune to the legal disabilities of the unmarried and to  acquire the legal benefits accorded to the married.  Lawful marriage in the society’s hierarchy  of values recognized by Boddie v. Connecticut and in the host of laws yet unchallenged – the  tax law, the common law of property, the law of evidence – is a constellation of these  immunities and privileges.  To say that legal immunities and legal benefits may not depend  upon marriage is to deny the vital right.  To say that Equal Protection requires the equal  treatment of the married and the unmarried in all respects is to deny the hierarchy of values of  our society.”  In addition, Article 23(2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that “[t]he right of  men and women of marriageable age to marry and to found a family shall be recognised”; and Article 18 of the  African [Banjul] Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights provides that “[t]he family shall be the natural unit and  basis of society.  It shall be protected by the State which shall take care of its physical health and moral.”   25

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 49 Freeman and Lyon Cohabitation without Marriage (Gower Publishing Company Limited, Hants, England  1997) at 19-20, describe the position of women in England in the following terms:  “The position of women in society today is closely related to their role within the family.  An  understanding of woman’s oppression accordingly requires a description and analysis of the  position of women in today’s privatised family.  As Mary McIntosh rightly has observed,  ‘ultimately the very construction of men and women as separate and opposed categories takes  place within, and in terms of, the family’.  Women are expected to be dependent on men.   Their role is geared to the household.  They are responsible for child care, as well as for the  care of the aged and handicapped.  Their domestic labour is seen as non-productive, not real  work.  Women, particularly married women, have to be housewives: if they do not carry out  the service roles depicted here they are ‘bad’ housewives, but housewives nevertheless.   Furthermore, as Kate Millett noted, ‘sex role is sex rank’.  ‘As long as woman’s place is  defined as separate, a male-dominated society will define her place as inferior’.” (footnotes  omitted)   30

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 81 Thus, in the First Certification case the question was whether the failure of the Bill of Rights expressly to  include a right to marry and constitute a family was inconsistent with one of the principles binding on the  Constitutional Assembly.  In Dawood the reminder about diversity and not entrenching particular forms of  family, was expressed.  National Coalition (2) and Du Toit were both concerned with same-sex couples who, in  terms of the common law definition of marriage and in terms of the Marriage Act 25 of 1961, were not able to  get their unions recognised as marriages even if they so wished.  The same jurisprudential movement away from  giving legal recognition only to registered marriages was reflected in Daniels, which dealt in part with the Act  which is being considered in the present matter.   122

CITATION ID : 82

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 82 Thus the cases concerning the rights of same-sex partners can be distinguished from the present one on the  basis that gay and lesbian couples could not marry, even if they wished to do so.  At the same time, these cases  established that difficulties of proving that such unions constituted permanent life partnerships, could be  overcome, and gave guidance as to how this should be done.  In Daniels, on the other hand, there was no legal  impediment to persons who were Muslim from formalising their marriages under the Marriage Act, which they  could do either by following up their religious ceremonies with a civil one, or else by being married by an Imam  who was recognised as a marriage officer.  The exercise of choice not to regularise the unions under the  Marriage Act had to be understood in the context of the hegemonic exclusion from recognition of Muslim  marriages effected by the common law as applied by the courts in the pre-constitutional era.  There was thus no  reason for interpreting the word “spouse” in the Act (as well as in the Intestate Succession Act) so as not to  include them.  In that matter, then, the fact that they chose not to formalise their marriages under the Marriage  Act did not debar them from claiming maintenance under the Act (or a share of the estate under the Intestate  Succession Act).  I will go no further than suggesting that the cases provide three indications of indirect  relevance to the issues before us.  The first is that, while pronouncing emphatically on the need not to straight- jacket families in conventional forms, this Court has expressly refrained from taking any position for or against  the recognition of heterosexual unmarried life partnerships.  The second is that in relation to questions of how to  prove the existence of permanent life partnerships, one may say that in the case of a non-formalised union,  where there is a judicial will, there will be a judicial way, and problems of proof will be overcome.  The third is  that a choice not to formalise one’s relationship under the Marriage Act will not inevitably and of itself  extinguish a claim by a survivor to maintenance under the Act (Daniels above n 45).  It is the context that must  be decisive, and in particular the social, political and legal factors which are said to have produced the  discriminatory treatment resulting in unfairness.     123

Contributions are made according to ability and in response to need.  In Satchwell what was at  issue was a potentially sizeable claim for a survivor’s pension chargeable against the public purse.  In these  circumstances the need to establish reciprocity of spousal-like undertakings of support was particularly strong.   In the case of a claim based on subsistence needs against the very estate that the survivor contributed to through  years of devoted support, the material interdependency should be seen as part of a broad mutual undertaking to  provide the kind of reciprocal support that binds intimate partners together.   128

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 92 In National Coalition (2) above n 79 at para 88, the following factors were considered in order to decide  whether a same-sex life partnership is permanent: “the respective ages of the partners; the duration of the  partnership; whether the partners took part in a ceremony manifesting their intention to enter into a permanent  partnership, what the nature of that ceremony was and who attended it; how the partnership is viewed by the  relations and friends of the partners; whether the partners share a common abode; whether the partners own or  lease the common abode jointly; whether and to what extent the partners share responsibility for living expenses  and the upkeep for the joint home; whether and to what extent one partner provides financial support for the  other; whether and to what extent the partners have made provision for one another in relation to medical,  pension and related benefits; whether there is a partnership agreement and what its contents are; and whether  and to what extent the partners have made provision in their wills for one another.”  The Court noted that  “[n]one of these considerations are indispensable for establishing a permanent partnership.”  I would add that in the case of heterosexual permanent partnerships proof would generally be easier.  There  would be a much greater likelihood of children, and not having had to cope with homophobia, the partners  would have been freer to associate in public as an intimate couple.    134

The question of whether they can or should be used to  support an allegation of bias is a difficult one which we do not attempt to consider fully here.  We record the  allegation and consider it on the basis of the ordinary rules regulating bias in favour of the state.  However, if  such conduct may be relied upon, it may well be that the considerations that arise from conduct in chambers  require greater circumspection by a court considering whether the conduct gives rise to a reasonable  apprehension of bias.  Given the conclusion we reach in this case, that is a question that can be left for further  and fuller consideration in another matter.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 28 The question whether, in the light of the decision in Makwanyane, an exception should be made to the right  to life to allow for the death sentence to be passed in serious cases, was thoroughly debated in the course of  the deliberations of the Constitutional Assembly, e.g. during the second reading debate on 7 May 1996.  Among other matters, the question of a qualification to the right to life to allow for the death sentence was  expressly raised and debated.  Ultimately a decision was taken that this should not be done.  Although  unanimity could not be reached on this particular question, the Constitution was adopted by an  overwhelming majority of the members of the Constitutional Assembly.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 30 In 1993 the Security Council unanimously adopted the statute for the International Criminal tribunal for the  former Yugoslavia (Resolution 827 (1993)).  In paragraph 1 of the resolution it approved the report of the  Secretary-General of 3 May 1993 in which he recommended in paragraph 112 that A[t]he International  Tribunal should not be empowered to impose the death penalty@.  That is reflected in Article 24 which  provides that A[t]he penalty imposed by the Trial Chamber shall be limited to imprisonment@.  See Morris  and Scharf An Insider=s Guide to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia Vol 1  (Transnational Publishers Inc, New York, 1995) at 274 and especially fn 713.  Even in the face of the  terrible genocide in Rwanda where over 500 000 people were murdered, the Security Council was not  prepared to compromise on the inclusion of the death penalty.  The statute was adopted by the Security  Council with one dissent (Rwanda) and one abstention (China).  In terms of Article 23 the penalty which  may be imposed by a trial chamber is limited to imprisonment.  In its explanation of vote on Resolution  955, New Zealand stated:

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 55 As to waiver generally, see South African Co-operative Citrus Exchange Ltd v Director-General: Trade  and Industry and Another 1997 (3) SA 236 (SCA) at 242GCH and 244DCE;  Ritch and Bhyat v Union  Government (Minister of Justice) 1912 AD 719 at 734C 5;  Reckitt and Colman (New Zealand) Ltd v  Taxation Board of Review and Another [1966] NZLR 1032 (CA) at 1042C3.  In S v Shaba and Another  1998 (2) BCLR 220 (T) at 221HCI, the court held that the private law doctrine of waiver is not applicable  to inalienable fundamental rights.  An individual may choose not to exercise a constitutionally protected  right, but is always free to change his or her mind without penalty.  De Waal et al The Bill of Rights  Handbook 4 ed (Juta, Cape Town, 2001) at 42C3, while suggesting t hat many Afreedom rights@ may be  waived, are of the view that rights to human dignity, life, and the right not to be discriminated against  cannot be waived.  In a similar vein, the German Federal Administrative Tribunal=s Peep Show decision  BVerwGe 64, 274 (1981) [English translation by Michalowski and Woods German Constitutional Law  B  The Protection of Civil Liberties (Ashgate/Dartmouth, Aldershot, 1999) at 105] states that A[h]uman dignity  is an objective, indisposable value, the respect of which the individual cannot waive validly.@  In Basheshar  Nath v The Commissioner of Income-Tax, Delhi & Rajasthan & Another [1959] Supp 1 SCR 528, Das CJ  of the Indian Supreme Court held that equality rights (Article 14) involve important public policy  considerations and can therefore not be waived (at 550C3).  In concurring opinions, Bhagwati (at 556C65)  and Subba Roa JJ (at 606C22) stated that all fundamental constitutional rights were instituted for public

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 34 Unlike the UK and European Union (EU), some US courts appear to have stuck to the narrow purpose of  trade mark protections by holding that “[i]t is the source-denoting function which the trade mark laws protect,  and nothing else.”  See for example Anti-Monopoly Inc v Gen Mills Fund Group 611 F 2d 296, 301 (9th Cir  1979).  Generally speaking, their courts aggressively protect the rights of the trade mark owner within this core  purpose but refuse to allow the owner to control public discourse whenever the public meaning of the mark goes  beyond the source-identifying purpose.  See above n 32.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 36 In the Trade Marks Act 194 of 1993 trade mark (other than a certification trade mark or a collective trade  mark) is defined as   “a mark used or proposed to be used by a person in relation to goods or services for the  purpose of distinguishing the goods or services in relation to which the mark is used or  proposed to be used from the same kind of goods or services connected in the course of trade  with any other person” (section 2(1)(xxiii)).  In terms of section 9, trade marks are deemed registrable only if they are, inherently or by reason of prior use,  “capable of distinguishing the goods or services of a person in respect of which it is registered or proposed to be  registered from the goods or services of another person”.  Section 10 limits section 9 by setting out specific  instances where trade marks may not be registered due, for example, to their being comprised of a sign or  indication that denotes the product’s origin, time of production, kind (subsection 2(b)) or to their being shaped  or coloured by natural or technical necessity (subsection 5).  Section 11 adds the further limitation that trade  marks may only be registered “in respect of goods or services falling in a particular class or particular classes”  (subsection 1).  It is clear from these provisions and others (such as sections 32 and 37) that the protection of the  distinct character of the mark for the purposes of preserving its selling power is the primary aim of the Act.  See  Beecham Group Plc v Triomed (Pty) Ltd 2003 (3) SA 639 (SCA) at 646A-B; National Brands n 28 above at  para 11.

This is because a High Court has already declared a particular  provision to be inconsistent with the Constitution.  There are good public policy reasons to  suggest that the uncertainty in relation to constitutional consistency ought not to be allowed to  prevail.  There is therefore a strong argument that the purpose of section 172(2) of the  Constitution is to ensure that the uncertainty generated by the High Court decision of  unconstitutionality is eliminated and that the substance of the debate raised by the declaration  is finally determined.”  See also the judgment of Madala J at para 80: “[T]hese are confirmation proceedings.

According to section 100 of the Act, it will take effect on 1 April 2010 or any earlier date fixed  by the President by proclamation in the Government Gazette.  Section 77(2) of the Act provides that:  “Notwithstanding any provision in this or any other law, a child who was 16 years or older at  the time of the commission of an offence referred to in Schedule 2 to the Criminal Law  Amendment Act, 1997 (Act no. 105 of 1997) must, if convicted, be dealt with in accordance  with the provisions of section 51 of that Act.”  Section 69(4) of the Act provides:  “When considering the imposition of a sentence involving imprisonment in terms of section  77, the child justice court must take the following factors into account:  (a) The seriousness of the offence, with due regard to—  (i)  the amount of harm done or risked through the offence;    and  (ii) the culpability of the child in causing or risking the harm;  (b) the protection of the community;  (c) the severity of the impact of the offence on the victim;  (d) the previous failure of the child to respond to non-residential alternatives, if  applicable; and  (e)  the desirability of keeping the child out of prison.”    Section 77(6) provides:  “In compliance with the Republic’s international obligations, no law, or sentence of  imprisonment imposed on a child, including a sentence of imprisonment for life, may,  directly or indirectly, deny, restrict or limit the possibility of earlier release of a child  sentenced to any term of imprisonment.”

CITATION ID : 24

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 24 He pointed out that the law could thus not easily accommodate same-sex unions because, unless the partners  thereto agreed as to who was to be the “husband” and who the “wife”, these rules could not readily be applied to  their union.  Sections 29 and 30 of the General Law Fourth Amendment Act 132 of 1993, however, abolished  the husband’s marital power over his wife’s person and property in respect of all marriages to which it applied,  and also his power flowing from his position as head of the family.  The only common law rule which makes it  necessary to be able to identify the husband and which still forms part of our law of matrimonial law, is the rule  which provides that the proprietary consequences of a marriage are determined, where prospective spouses have  different domiciles, by the law of the domicile of the husband at the time of the marriage.  All other rules apply  equally to spouses.  Farlam JA stated that he does not believe that the impossibility of applying this rule to  same-sex unions would give rise to insoluble problems.  The existence of this problem, he held, would not  constitute a reason for refusing to extend the definition in the way that the SCA had been asked to do.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 51 The judgment cites Timothy E Lin “Social Norms and Judicial Decisionmaking: Examining the Role of  Narratives in Same-Sex Adoption Cases”:  “[T]here is the story of lesbians and gays that centres on their sexuality.  Whether because of  disgust, confusion, or ignorance about homosexuality, lesbian and gay sexuality dominates the  discourse of not only same-sex adoption, but all lesbian and gay issues.  The classification of  lesbians and gays as ‘exclusively sexual beings’ stands in stark contrast to the perception of  heterosexual parents as ‘people who, along with many other activities in their lives,  occasionally engage in sex.’  Through this narrative, lesbians and gays are reduced to one- dimensional creatures, defined by their sex and sexuality.”  (Footnote omitted.)  Home Affairs  above n 44 at para 49.

We have every kind of  family: extended families, nuclear families, one-parent families, same-sex families, and in  relation to each one of these there are [controversies, difficulties] and cases coming before the  courts or due to come before the courts.  This is the result of ancient history and recent  history.  I am not proposing to go through the few hundred thousand years ever since Lucy  [the African common ancestor of all humanity], but one can say that family law in South  Africa or the problems of family law are the product of the way our subcontinent was peopled,  the way we were colonised, the way the colonists were subsequently colonised, the way we  were separated and the way we came together again.  Our families are suffused with history,  as family law is suffused with history, culture, belief and personality.  For researchers it’s a  paradise, for judges a purgatory.”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 80 In this respect it should be borne in mind that since the abolition of the patriarchal powers once vested by the  common law in the husband, spouses enjoy equality in marriage.  Same-sex marriages therefore would not be  required to replicate between the partners the formerly unequal or divergently stereotyped roles of husband and  wife in marriage.  The achievement of heterosexual equality thus removed a potentially serious barrier to  homosexual equality.  In all material respects, then, sexual orientation survives as a neutral factor as far as the  conjugal family law interests are concerned.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 81 For example De Vos “Gay and Lesbian Legal Theory” in Jurisprudence Roederer and Moellendorf (eds)  (Juta, Cape Town, 2004) at 349-50, raises the question of why the state should provide special legal recognition  to only those relationships which conform to a heterosexual stereotype, thereby further marginalising and  oppressing those whose relationships are less traditional in form.  See also Cheshire Calhoun Feminism, the  Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement (Oxford University Press, Cape Town,  2000) at 113, who points out that the argument that same-sex marriage rights depend on the view that the state  ought to promote one normative ideal for intimacies, plays directly into queer theorists’ and lesbian feminists’  worst fears:  “Queer theorists worry that pursuing marriage rights is assimilationist, because it rests on the  view that it would be better for gay and lesbian relationships to be as much like traditional  heterosexual intimate relationships as possible.  To pursue marriage rights is to reject the  value of pursuing possibly more liberating, if less conventional, sexual, affectional, care- taking, and economic intimate arrangements.  Feminists worry that pursuing marriage rights  will have the effect of endorsing gender-structured heterosexual marriage . . . .”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 82 The literature suggests, however, that most gay people in South Africa dream of getting married.  See  Gevisser “Mandela’s stepchildren: homosexual identity in post-apartheid South Africa” in Different Rainbows  Peter Drucker (ed) (Gay Men’s Press, London, 2000) at 135.  For many the dream is attenuated by present  reality. See Ruth Morgan and Saskia Wieringa Tommy Boys, Lesbian Men and Ancestral Wives: Female same- sex practices in Africa (Jacana, Johannesburg, 2005) at 321.  Writing about gay identity in a black township on  the outskirts of Ermelo, Reid “‘A man is a man completely and a wife is a wife completely’: Gender  classification and performance amongst ‘ladies’ and ‘gents’ in Ermelo, Mpumalanga” in Men Behaving  Differently Graeme Reid and Liz Walker (eds) (Double Storey, Cape Town, 2005) write that  “[s]ame-sex engagement and marriage ceremonies which take place in the region are events  where traditions are both evoked and reinvented.  They constitute significant social occasions  where the performance of gender is enacted in a particular, ritualised way.  These events are  also topics for seemingly endless speculation, rumour, gossip and fantasy.”  (At 221.)    He goes on to write that that while Bhuti (one of his informants) may have fantasised about a white wedding and  honeymoon, Zakhi aspired towards a more traditionally African engagement and wedding ceremony, which  includes lobola negotiations between the families and an umhlambiso engagement followed by a white wedding.    “Marriage signals a pinnacle of social acceptance and equality before the law.  The fact that  individuals are getting married in spite of the law suggests that social acceptance and the quest  for respectability is a primary motivating factor.”    One organiser complained that in gay weddings there was far too much emphasis placed on superficial things  such as rings, food and especially clothing at the expense of more substantial issues such as the quality of the  relationship.

Our list of identifying terms is far from  comprehensive and each item on that list indicates a different configuration of identity, desire,  practice, possibility, held together by the phrase ‘sexual orientation’ in the South African  Constitution – the meaning of which is continually being revised by the South African courts.”    He adds that significant legislative victories have been won, also affecting the meaning of the phrase.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 96 In the 2002 René Cassin lecture published in Recognising Religion in a Secular Society: Essays in Pluralism,  Religion, and Public Policy Douglas Farrow (ed), Canadian Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin points out that  the law faces the seemingly paradoxical task of asserting its own ultimate authority while carving out a space  within itself in which individuals and communities can manifest alternate, and often competing, sets of ultimate  commitments.  (At 16.)  She refers to the tension between the rule of law and the claims of religion as a dialectic  of normative commitments:  “What is good, true, and just in religion will not always comport with the law’s view of the  matter, nor will society at large always properly respect conscientious adherence to alternate  authorities and divergent normative, or ethical commitments.  Where this is so, two  comprehensive worldviews collide.  It is at this point that the question of law’s treatment of  religion becomes truly exigent.  The authority of each is internally unassailable. What is more,  both lay some claim to the whole of human experience. . . . This clash of forces demands a  resolution from the courts.  The reality of litigation means that cases must be resolved.  The  dialectic must reach synthesis.”  (At 21-2.)    She then goes on to show how the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides the courts with a  context for reconciling the competing world views.  (At 28-33.)  For a critique of what is referred to as  triumphalistic secular fundamentalism that seeks to impose secular dogma on the whole of society, see  Benson “Considering Secularism” in Recognising Religion in a Secular Society id at 95.

The first is that gays and lesbians cannot be forced to conform to  heterosexual norms; they can now break out of their invisibility and live as full and free  citizens of South Africa.  The second is that those persons who for reasons of religious or  other belief disagree with or condemn homosexual conduct are free to hold and articulate such  beliefs.  Yet, while the Constitution protects the right of people to continue with such beliefs,  it does not allow the State to turn these beliefs – even in moderate or gentle versions – into  dogma imposed on the whole of society.”    It should be added that, conversely, the Constitution does not allow the state to impose an orthodoxy of secular  beliefs on the whole of society, including religious organisations conducting religious activities as protected by  the Constitution.

Believing, as these whites did, that intimacy with the black or yellow races would  lower the whites without raising the supposed inferior races in the scale of civilization, they  condemned intermarriage or illicit intercourse between persons of the two races.   Unfortunately the practice of many white men has often been inconsistent with that belief . . . .   These prepossessions, or, as many might term them, these prejudices, have never died out . . . .   We may not from a philosophical or humanitarian point of view be able to approve this  prevalent sentiment, but we cannot, as judges who are called upon to construe an Act of  Parliament, ignore the reasons which must have induced the legislature to adopt the policy of  separate education for European and non-European children.”

He went on to say:  “[A] division of the community on differences of race or language for the purpose of postal  service seems, prima facie, to be sensible and make for the convenience and comfort of the  public as a whole, since appropriate officials conversant with the customs, requirements and  language of each section will conceivably serve the respective sections.”  (At 175.)    De Villiers JA likened division on the ground of race to division on the ground of initial letters of one’s name.   Only Beyers JA and Gardiner JA confronted the racist social reality involved.  Supporting the regulation, Beyers  JA held that in the Transvaal Europeans and non-Europeans had never been treated as equal in the eyes of the  law.  “Afskeiding loop deur ons ganse maatskaplik lewe in die hele Unie”. (Separation is to be found in all of  social life in the whole of the Union [of South Africa]”.  My translation.)  (At 177.)  Gardiner JA, on the other  hand, regarded the regulation as invalid:    “In view of the prevalent feeling as to colour, in view of the numerous statutes treating non- Europeans as belonging to an inferior order of civilisation, any fresh classification on colour  lines can, to my mind, be interpreted only as a fresh instance of relegation of Asiatics and  natives to a lower order, and this I consider humiliating treatment.”  (At 190-1.)

Equality does not necessarily connote  identical treatment; in fact, different treatment may be called for in certain cases to promote equality.  Equality,  in that context, does not demand that practices which are forbidden where male officers guard female inmates  must also be banned where female officers guard male inmates.  Given the historical, biological and sociological  differences between men and women, it was clear that the effect of cross-gender searching is different and more  threatening for women than for men.  The important government objectives of inmate rehabilitation and security  of the institution are promoted as a result of the humanising effect of having women in these positions.   Moreover, Parliament's ideal of achieving employment equity was given a material application by way of this  initiative.  The proportionality of the means used to the importance of these ends would thus justify any breach  of equality.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 160 In Christian Education above n 73 at para 35, this Court held that:  “The underlying problem in any open and democratic society based on human dignity,  equality and freedom in which conscientious and religious freedom has to be regarded with  appropriate seriousness, is how far such democracy can and must go in allowing members of  religious communities to define for themselves which laws they will obey and which not.   Such a society can cohere only if all its participants accept that certain basic norms and  standards are binding.  Accordingly, believers cannot claim an automatic right to be exempted  by their beliefs from the laws of the land.  At the same time, the State should, wherever  reasonably possible, seek to avoid putting believers to extremely painful and intensely  burdensome choices of either being true to their faith or else respectful of the law.”  (My  emphasis.)

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 1     In parenthesis, I point out that section 241(8) applies to civil as well as criminal proceedings. In Roman Dutch law there was some controversy whether civil proceedings were pending only upon litis contestatio or upon service of the summons. Modern authority favours the latter view.  Michaelson v Lowenstein 1905 TS 3241 ;  Van As v Apollos and Others 1993(1) SA 606(C), 609.  See also S v Saib 1994(2) BCLR 48(D), 53; 1994(4) SA 554(D), 559 per Thirion J. 26 in the latter case at 558, in the normal meaning of the term proceedings "are pending if they have begun but not yet finished."   It is clear enough that a "pending" proceeding is one not yet decided.  See King v King 1971(2) SA 630(O), 634; Groenewald v Minister van Justisie 1972(4) SA 223(O), 225.  What is not so clear is when a legal proceeding may be said to have begun.  [52] Section 144(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1977, requires an indictment to be served on an accused at least ten days before the date appointed for trial, and section 76 states that the proceedings at a summary trial in a superior court shall be commenced by the serving of an indictment on the accused and the lodging thereof with the registrar of the court concerned.  There is nothing in the judgment of Page J to indicate whether the Afrikaans indictment was withdrawn or was lodged with the registrar and, in the latter event, on what date it was lodged. These matters and, in general, the date of commencement of the proceedings, were and are questions for the trial court to decide.   All that one can say at this stage is that unless a duly served indictment was lodged with the registrar before the 27th April, there would appear to be no basis on which it could be contended that on 27th April, 1994, the proceedings were "pending" in terms of section 241(8).1  But it does not follow that, in the context of section 241(8), proceedings are pending as soon as the indictment is lodged.  It may be that for the purposes of that section criminal proceedings are pending only on plea, or when the evidence has begun.  (Compare section 344 (3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977.)   That is a question we do not now decide.   [53] At all events, at the trial before Page J the State prima facie established that in relation to at least two of the confessions tendered, the requirements of section 217(1) (b)(ii) had been satisfied.  But before any further evidence was led, and after hearing argument, the learned judge decided to refer the constitutional issues to this Court.  His reasoning, in essence,

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 2     As Chapter 3 for the most part confers rights on individuals rather than removes them there will not be many instances where retrospectivity in 33 [66] There is a different presumption where a new law effects changes in procedure.   It is presumed that such a law will apply to every case subsequently tried "no matter when such case began or when the cause of action arose" - Curtis v Johannesburg Municipality 1906 TS 308, 312.  It is, however, not always easy to decide whether a new statutory provision is purely procedural or whether it also affects substantive rights.  Rather than categorising new provisions in this way, it has been suggested, one should simply ask whether or not they would affect vested rights if applied retrospectively.  See Yew Bon Tew v Kenderaan Bas Mara [1983] 1 AC 553 (PC), 563; Industrial Council for Furniture Manufacturing Industry, Natal v Minister of Manpower and Another 1984(2) SA 238(D), 242.   [67] There is still another well-established rule of construction namely, that even if a new statute is intended to be retrospective in so far as it affects vested rights and obligations, it is nonetheless presumed not to affect matters which are the subject of pending legal proceedings.  See Bell v Voorsitter van die Rasklassifikasieraad en Andere 1968(2) SA 678(A);  Bellairs v Hodnett and Another 1978(1) SA 1109(A), 1148. [68] Problems of retrospectivity may arise in relation to new Constitutions as they do in relation to other new statutes. They arose in relation to the introduction of the Canadian Charter of Rights.  See R v Antoine (1983) 4 CRR 126.  In the South African Constitution express provisions obviate at least some of the major problems of retrospectivity.   Section 4(1) provides - "This Constitution shall be the supreme law of the Republic and any law or act inconsistent with its provisions shall, unless otherwise provided expressly or by necessary implication in this Constitution, be of no force or effect to the extent of the inconsistency." Section 7(2), which is part of Chapter 3, provides - "This Chapter shall apply to all law in force and all administrative decisions taken and acts performed during the period of operation of this Constitution." These provisions mean that Chapter 3 prima facie has effect as from the commencement of the Constitution even if the result is to impair a vested right.  In that sense it is retrospective.2

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 3     For that reason it seems to have been unnecessary to invoke section 241(8) in Kalla v Master of the Supreme Court, supra: the case could have been decided in the same way be reference to section 7(2). 34 The importance of section 7(2) is that it enables any person to invoke the Constitution as a protection against any unconstitutional official action taken against him or her, after 27th April 1994, even if that action arises from that person's conduct before 27th April 1994.  On the other hand it follows from section 7(2) that official acts completed before 27th April 1994 are not invalidated by anything in the Constitution.3   [69] It is against this background that the purpose of section 241(8) can be understood.  The purposes, I suggest, were twofold. First, to ensure that Courts which had derived their power to hear cases from the old Constitution, could continue to hear them under the new Constitution.  Here I am in agreement with Mahomed J, and broadly with the reasons which he has given for that conclusion.  But that is not the only purpose of section 241(8).  It is clear from the language used, that there was another purpose, and that was to ensure that there would be an orderly transition from the old to the new legal order, so as to avoid the dislocation which would be caused by introducing a radically different set of legal concepts in the middle of ongoing proceedings. [70] There is no warrant for reading section 241(8) as merely preserving the territorial jurisdiction of the courts in pending matters.  First, the sub-section states no such limitation. Second, sub-sections (1) and (10) of section 241, expressly preserve jurisdiction of existing Courts, in all proceedings. If section 241(8) merely preserved  territorial jurisdiction in pending cases it would be entirely superfluous.  The reliance which some judgments place on the proviso is in my opinion misconceived.  The effect of a proviso is to except something from the preceding portion of the enactment which, but for the proviso, would be within it.  It cannot be construed as if it were an enacting clause.  R v Dibdin [1910] P 57, 125;  Mphosi v Central Board for Co-Operative Insurance Ltd. 1974(4) SA 633(A), 645.  "Pending proceedings" include an appeal from the original proceedings - S v Thomas and Another 1978(1) SA 329(A). The proviso to section 241(8) in my view does no more than ensure that, notwithstanding the main enactment, appeals may go

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 5     The offending section casts the onus on an accused in certain circumstances to establish the involuntariness of an extra-curial confession. This was found to be an unwarranted infringement of the right to a fair trial guaranteed by section 25(3) of the Constitution. 42 individual rights, if necessary against the public interest.  I thus agree with the approach to constitutional interpretation found in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Hunter et al v Southam Inc. (1984) 9 CRR 355, at 364-5, and find the narrow approach to the language of a constitution exemplified by Government of the Republic of Bophuthatswana and Others v Segale 1990(1) SA 434(B AD), especially at 448-9, unacceptable. Nonetheless, there are some provisions, even in a constitution, where the language used, read in its context, is too clear to be capable of sensible qualification.  It is the duty of all courts, in terms of section 35, to promote the values which underlie a democratic society based on freedom and equality.  In the long run, I respectfully suggest, those values are not promoted by doing violence to the language of the Constitution in order to remedy what may seem to be hard cases. [85] This, I fear, over-long consideration of section 241(8) is motivated, if not excused, by the need to resolve the considerable conflicts of judicial opinion to which I have referred.  The immediate result of it is that in my view the retrospectivity which we gave to our ruling in the Zuma case under section 98(6) must remain limited to cases in proceedings which began on or after 27th April 1994, i.e. which were not pending on that date.  We cannot override section 241(8).  Since this is a minority judgment nothing need be said about the form of order. Chaskalson P, Ackermann J and Didcott J concur in the judgment of Kentridge AJ. [86] KRIEGLER J: In another case argued contemporaneously with this one,4 we held that section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 is unconstitutional because it  assails the right of an accused to a fair trial.5  In this case the same question arose but judgment was held over because the case raises the further question whether an accused whose case was pending when the Constitution came into operation is entitled to the benefits it confers.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 6     The law reports reflect no less than 18 cases reported up to March 1995.  Several further cases did not make their way to the law reports.  The gist of these cases is discussed by Kentridge AJ. 43 numerous cases around the country.6  It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that the cases produced as many answers as there were judgments.  The present case runs true to form. There is manifestly a sharp division of opinion among the members of this Court.  On the one hand Kentridge AJ, supported by three colleagues, has concluded that the benefits of chapter 3 do not accrue to an accused whose case was pending on 27 April 1995.  On the other hand, my colleague Mahomed J, with the concurrence of a number of justices, has come to the opposite conclusion.  Sachs J agrees with them, but for different reasons.  Although I have come to the same conclusion as the latter group and subscribe to the order formulated by Mahomed J, my reasoning is somewhat different and ought to be recorded. [88] If one asks the wrong question, one is likely to come up with the wrong answer.  And to my mind, the question in this case is emphatically not:  What is the effect of section 241(8) of the Constitution.  The correct question is as I have formulated it in the opening paragraph of this judgment. [89] There is universal consensus that the Constitution ushered in the most fundamental change in the history of our country.  It made everything new.  The country's national territory (section 1), its national symbols (section 2), its languages (section 3), and its citizenship (section 5) were created anew.  The Constitution gave birth to a new legislature (chapter 4), a new executive (chapter 6), and a new judiciary (chapter 7).  More significantly, in the present context, it created justiciable fundamental rights and freedoms (chapter 3).  Above all, it established a constitutional democracy in which the Constitution itself was to be the supreme law of the land and would "bind all legislative, executive and judicial organs of state" (section 4).  It was a fundamental metamorphosis. [90] The aspect of that metamorphosis with which we are most directly concerned is the recognition of fundamental rights and freedoms in chapter 3.  That chapter recognises for every person a comprehensive set of rights and freedoms enforceable in a court of law. It commences with section 7, which imperiously makes the chapter binding on "all legislative and executive organs of state" and applicable to "all law in force ... during the period of operation of this Constitution".  In terms of section 251(1) of the Constitution that period of operation commenced on 27 April 1994.  It must follow that on that day every person became

Section 239 provides for continuity and order in the disposition of state assets and liabilities and section 240 for the continuation of the State Revenue Fund.  Then follows section 241, which deals with transitional and continuity arrangements for the judiciary, and section 242 which makes provision for its subsequent rationalization.  Sections 243 to 246 make transitional arrangements regarding the Ombudsman, the Auditor General, local government structures, and the pensions of political office bearers.  The whole pattern of the chapter is manifestly to ensure orderly continuity of function and authority. [94] That, then, is the light in which section 241 is to be read. Quite logically it commences in subsection (1) with continuity of the judiciary.  This is done by the simple stratagem of deeming the existing courts to be the new courts constituted in terms of the Constitution.7  It is followed by three provisos and two substantive subsections which were inserted later.8  The amendments were aimed at the orderly winding down of appellate tribunals that had been created in the former TBVC territories. Subsection (2), linking up with subsection (1), then deems the erstwhile Supreme Court judges to have been appointed under the Constitution.  We therefore have continuity of courts and of their judges.  Subsection (3) then keeps all other judicial officers in their posts, subsection (4) does the same for attorneys-general, while subsections (5) and (6) maintain their salaries and pensions.  Judges, magistrates and attorneys- general of the old regime having been kept in office, subsection (7) requires them to take a fresh oath of office.  By-passing subsection (8) for the moment, we see that subsections (9) and (10) are also concerned with continuity.  Subsection (9) allows pending legal proceedings against a government body to be continued against any successor while subsection (10) keeps in operation for the time being all pre-existing laws relating to the jurisdiction, procedures, powers, establishment and functioning of courts of law and judicial officers. [95] Viewed in that matrix, subsection (8) of section 241, despite the equivocal nature of its wording, should hold no terrors.  It

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 11     Supra note 4. 47 interpretation a purposive and generous focus",9 is applicable to chapters 2 and 3.  It has no place in the interpretation of section 241(8).  The former are concerned with the broad brush- strokes of the constitutional canvas.  Peer at them too closely and you lose focus, thus missing the picture.  The latter has a narrow, technical and brief purpose and scope.  To understand and correctly apply it require close reading, not a generous perspective.   [98] The ultimate conclusion to which I come is therefore, that no accused person whose case was pending on 27 April 1994 is precluded from sharing in the benefits bestowed by the new Constitution.  Such an accused is entitled to claim any one or more of the rights conferred by chapter 3 and the presiding officer is obliged to entertain such claim.  In particular the accused in such a case against whom a confession had already been admitted under section 217(1)(b)(ii) of Act 51 of 1971 is entitled to have its admissibility reconsidered without the application of that subsection by the court whether the decision to admit was made before or after 27 April 1995.  In terms of section 98(6)(a) of the Constitution10 an order invalidating an act of Parliament dating from the previous era does not automatically invalidate anything done under such old act before the declaration of invalidity.  However this Court is empowered to order otherwise if it is "in the interests of justice and good government" to do so.  In S v Zuma and Others,11 we exercised that power and effectively banned the use of section 217(1)(b)(ii) of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1977 in all uncompleted cases which had commenced on or after 27 April 1994. In my view a corresponding order should be made extending the prohibition to all criminal trials, whenever they commenced.  In effect, I therefore endorse the views expressed by Eloff JP in

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 12     1995 (1) BCLR 97 at 102H-103B (W).  48 Jurgens v Editor, Sunday Times Newspaper, and Another:12 "... section 241(1) legitimates all courts of law existing at the time when the Constitution came into force.  Section 241(10) provides that all measures which regulate the functions of courts of law shall continue to remain in force until amended or repealed.  Neither of these subsections deal with the situation where proceedings have already commenced before a Court which has been legitimised and which is to continue to function in terms of existing legislative measures in terms of section 241(0).  The purpose of the first part of section 241(8) is then to provide for the continuation of proceedings which were pending on 27 April 1994.  The procedure then to be followed is that prescribed by laws in force up to 27 April 1994, even though the new Constitution may establish principles inconsistent with the old procedure. "It is in my view significant that section 241 hardly deals with substantive law; procedure and jurisdictional matters, and the status and function of Judges and judicial officers are in general dealt with.  In that setting section 241(8) has to be seen and interpreted." I think the learned judge, in saying that the section "hardly" dealt with substantive law, was resorting to understatement. [99] I have not dealt with the debate concerning interpretive presumptions regarding retroactivity and retrospectivity in the case of statutory amendments.  To my mind the adoption of a Constitution which operates as a supreme law does not fall to be interpreted along such lines.  It is not a case of one statute repealing, amending or replacing one or more others.  What we are concerned with here is a supreme statute being superimposed on the whole of the existing legal landscape, bathing the whole of it in its beneficent light.  In the true sense of the words, it is not retroactive nor retrospective.  What it does mean, though, is that the moment when the judicial officer has to deal with a claim under chapter 3 he or she has to ask whether such right exists.  Moreover, if the particular right or claim had already been disposed of in an interlocutory order made before the Constitution came into operation, such ruling would have to reconsidered thereafter.  If, in the instant case, the prosecution had tendered the confessions and they had been admitted under the authority of section 217(1)(b)(ii) prior to 27 April 1994, the presiding judge would have had to reverse such ruling if a claim for such reversal were made after that date but prior to verdict.

It can safely be postulated that the number of cases that were pending when the Constitution came into operation ran to tens of thousands. 49 judgment) that the referral in the instant case was not legally competent. 2. I also agree with his view (paragraphs 59-61 of his judgment) that the possible effect of section 241(8) of the Constitution is of such public importance that we ought to consider and determine the issue. 3. I disagree with the conclusion regarding the interpretation of section 241(8) reached by Kentridge AJ and agree with that of Mahomed and Sachs JJ, although for different reasons. 4. The essence of my deviation from the reasoning of Mahomed J is that I ascribe a more mundane function to section 241(8) than he does.  I agree with him that the creation of the new courts, despite - and possibly to an extent because of - the Phoenix-like emergence of the old judiciary in new feathers, gave rise to the risk of a gap being perceived between the old and the new.  However, as I see it, that risk is fully met by subsections (1) to (3) and (10) of section 241.  Subsection (8) serves merely to designate the fora to deal with pending cases. 5. I agree with Sachs J that different parts of the Constitution need to be read with different spectacles.  I do not agree with him, however, that section 241(8) is to be contrasted with or evaluated against chapter 3.  On my interpretation they have entirely different fields of application.  They are not in conflict; on the contrary, they supplement one another, each in its own field. 6.  I share with Mahomed and Sachs JJ a profound disbelief that the framers of the Constitution could conceivably have purported to give, with one hand, the fundamental rights and freedoms to all, only, surreptitiously with the other, to withhold its benefits from the many thousands of persons whose criminal cases must have been pending on 27 April 1994.13 [101] I therefore agree with the order formulated by Mahomed J. [102] SACHS J:  I share with Mahomed J a disbelief that the framers of the Constitution intended a reading of section 241(8) which would produce the anomalous and unjust results to which he refers.

This involves a species of interactive proportionality.  It moves the nature of the enquiry from the so-called plain meaning of words looked at on their own, or even in context, to the interactive purposes of different provisions, read together.15 [108] Discord and dissonance have their role to play in law as in music.  To be justified, however, they should not be accidental, but intended, not unfortunate but purposeful. A textual construction which harmonizes different provisions within the overall design of the Constitution is generally to be preferred to one which, however coherent within its own terms, produces disharmony. There are indeed many provisions in the Constitution where it is clear that, for reasons of inclusivity, compromise and smooth transition, special arrangements were made and particular textures were introduced, not all of them obviously consistent with the broad general principles of the Constitution.  These would include the so-called sunset clauses and provisions introduced on behalf of special interest groups. For the purposes of the present discussion, it is not necessary to identify them.  In each case, the wording and the purpose go together:  the provisions were inserted to deal with special cases and special situations, and to go back on them would be to undermine finely honed texts of exceptional import to particular sections of the community.  In these cases, any departure from the text produced by reference to other sections of the Constitution, and any consequent strained interpretation or cutting down or extension of words, would require very strong and compelling contextual justification indeed.  [109] Section 241(8) is of a totally different order.  Its function is to be functional.  It is not there to protect any particular interest, or to develop any constitutional principle, or even nuance.  It is as technical and dry a provision as one can get; far from being one of the letters of the constitutional alphabet, it is at most a dot on the 'i' or a cross on the 't'.

Section 241(8) David takes on Chapter 3 Goliath, but this time it is Goliath who is the righteous one.  Incredulity, if constitutionally and not subjectively based, should be a strong factor in the process of interpretive choice. It credits the framers with firmness of purpose and frailty of means, rather than frailty of purpose and firmness of means.  [110] The rights enshrined in Chapter 3, on the other hand, are deeply entrenched, not only in relation to Parliament, but in respect of the rest of the Constitution.  In my view, the strength of the Chapter 3 rights and the intensity of the values they promote are central to the whole constitutional scheme, and are fundamental to our role as defenders of the constitution.  They link up directly with the oath we recently took to 'uphold and protect the Constitution of the Republic and the fundamental rights entrenched therein and in so doing administer justice to all persons alike' [Schedule 3].  Only the most compelling language would justify a departure from such a clear responsibility.  The meaning of these words could not be plainer.  Even on the literalist extreme of the literalist/purposive continuum, one is bound to ask what happens when two sets of plain meaning come into conflict with each other, that of Chapter 3 on the one hand, and that of section 241(8), on the other? [111] The introduction of fundamental rights and constitutionalism in South Africa represented more than merely entrenching and extending existing common law rights, such as might happen if Britain adopted a Bill of Rights.  The Constitution introduces democracy and equality for the first time in South Africa.  It acknowledges a past of intense suffering and injustice, and promises a future of reconciliation and reconstruction.  It embodies compromise in the form a Government of National Unity, and orderly reconstruction of the constitutional order in terms of the two-phase process of constitution-making which it provides for.  It is a momentous document, intensely value- laden.  To treat it with the dispassionate attention one might give to a tax law would be to violate its spirit as set out in unmistakably plain language.  It would be as repugnant to the spirit, design and purpose of the Constitution as a purely technical, positivist and value-free approach to the post-Nazi

It connects up, reinforces and underlies all of the text that follows.  It helps to establish the basic design of the Constitution and indicate its fundamental purposes.18 (See too the concluding passages)19  This is not a case of making the Constitution mean what we like,20 but of making it mean what the framers wanted it to mean; we gather their intention not from our subjective wishes, but from looking at the document as a whole.21 [113] One way of dealing with the two sets of mutually contradictory provisions would be to apply a variant of the presumption to the effect that general provisions do not trump, override or derogate from specific ones.  [Generalia specialibus non derogant - general provisions do not derogate from special provisions].  This is normally applied when a new statute containing general words is applied to an old statute with specific provisions that are not expressly repealed.22  In the leading English case of The Vera Cruz Lord Selborne said: "Now if anything is certain it is this, that where there are general words in a later Act capable of reasonable and sensible application without extending them to subjects specially dealt with by earlier legislation, you are not to hold that earlier and special legislation indirectly repealed, altered, or derogated from merely by force of such general words, without any indication of a particular intention to do so."23

The technical difficulty would be to decide which was general and which specific:  Chapter 3 has a specific ambit but is of general application; section 241(8) is said to have unlimited ambit, but has only specific application. Perhaps the answer would be to allow what was specific from each to survive, namely, the specific ambit of Chapter 3 to co-exist with the specific application of section 241(8).  Although I would regard the result as satisfactory, the means are artificial and if employed in other cases could lead to serious constitutional deformation.   [115] In any event, a question mark has to be placed over the usefulness of common law presumptions in interpreting the Constitution.  As Wilson J pointed out in a notable dissent,24 'such presumptions can be inconsistent with the purposive approach to Charter interpretation which focuses on the broad purposes for which the rights were designed and not on mechanical rules which have traditionally been employed in interpreting detailed provisions of ordinary statutes in order to discern legislative intent'.  Sir Rupert Cross suggests that even in relation to ordinary statutes, the increasing use of a purposive approach makes the role of presumptions 'necessarily less important than in the days of more literal interpretation'.25 [116] The preferred approach, as I have indicated, is not to search for what is general and what is specific, but rather to seek out the essential purposes and interest to be served by the two competing sets of provisions, and then, using a species of proportionality, balance them against each other.  The objective is to achieve appropriate weight for each and preserve as much as possible of both.  To extend the analogy, there are no trumps, but there are cards of higher and lower value.  [117] Another way of dealing with the tension between Chapter 3 and section 241(8) would be to regard Chapter 3 as part of the context in which section 241(8) is to be construed, and, applying a purposive approach to interpretation, cut back the wide meaning of the section so as to avoid anomalies and

A well-known South African example of where 'the true intention' of the legislature, as determined by the context, was used to cut down the wide language of a provision is R v Venter.26  The text under consideration in that case provided that 'any person entering [the Transvaal] shall be guilty of an offence ..... if he has been convicted elsewhere .... of .... theft'.  The court held that the words 'any person' could not be given their ordinary full meaning, since this would result in Transvaal residents returning to the colony being guilty of an offence, when the context of the statute made it clear that the mischief aimed at was the influx of criminals from abroad.  Innes CJ said that 'the court may depart from the ordinary effect of the words to the extent necessary to remove the absurdity and to give effect to the true intention of the legislature'.27  Both Innes CJ and Solomon J explain that their decision in that particular case to depart from the plain meaning of the statute is not based on absurdity but on identification of the mischief aimed at, and the need to avoid repugnancy to the intention of the legislature.   [118] It is true that, as Dr L.C. Steyn points out28 the Venter principle was subsequently watered down by most South African judges by restricting its operation to what was called a small class of extreme cases.  Yet, as Dr Steyn observes, the judgments were not all one way, and the Roman Dutch Authorities strongly supported the approach adopted in Venter (he quotes Donellus as saying that " Die wil behoort nie die woorde te dien nie, maar die woorde die wil.  By die sake, gevalle, tye en persone wat nie deur die bedoeling van die wet gedek word nie, hou die wet ook op, en daar en tot die mate maak die woorde geen reg uit nie, hoe seer ook die algemene woorde hulle almal omvat").29 [119] The issue now is not whether the Venter principle should be more widely applied in relation to the interpretation of statutes, but whether the approach it adopts should be given appropriate scope in relation to the construction of the Constitution.

Their main point is the need to distinguish between grammatical exegesis and constitutional analysis.  56 my view, it should.  By emphasising the way in which context can modify the plain meaning of words, it conforms to overwhelming international practice.30  [120] It also corresponds to what academic commentators in South Africa have long been arguing for, as part of their general critique of legal positivism.31 [121] Finally, it would contradict as a premature lamentation, the prediction of commentators on the new Constitution that South African Courts are likely to continue to manifest 'an almost slavish adherence to Anglocentric legal traditions and concepts'.32 [122] Whatever Anglocentric legal tradition might be, contemporary Anglo-centrism would in fact support rather than undermine a context-based, purposive approach.  Membership of the European Union has had its effect on English judges.  Lord Denning explained the approach of European judges in the following terms:   "[They] adopt a method which they call in English by strange words - at any rate they were strange to me - the 'schematic and teleological'

All it means is that the judges do not go by the literal meaning of the words or by the grammatical structure of the sentence.  They go by the design or purpose which lies behind it.  When they come upon a situation which is to their minds within the spirit - but not the letter - of the legislation, they solve the problem by looking at the design and purpose of the legislature - at the effect it was sought to achieve.  They then interpret the legislation so as to produce the desired effect.  This means they fill in gaps, quite unashamedly, without hesitation.  They ask simply: what is the sensible way of dealing with this situation so as to give effect to the presumed purpose of the legislation.  They lay down the law accordingly."33 [123] Cross quotes Lord Wilberforce as denying 'the tired old myth' that English judges are more literalist and narrow than continental courts, and goes on to say that at least nowadays, judges in England adopt a purposive approach to statutory interpretation, rather than a narrow literal one.34 "Of course", the book observes "a literal approach need not be a particularly narrow one - an unrestrictive construction of general words may be excessively literal and insufficiently purposive, but the usual charge under this head is one of narrow literalism". [124] The general approach adopted by Cross is to urge the judges to function in an unapologetically purposive fashion and not be afraid to acknowledge that they can and do 'rectify' the text when the words used in a particular formulation defeat or go against the general purpose of the statute.  He argues strongly in favour of a contextual approach and quotes with approval the observation by Viscount Simonds that " .... words, and particularly general words, cannot be read in isolation; their colour and content are derived from their context".35 [125] A purposive and mischief-orientated reading as against a purely literal one, always involves a degree of strain on the language. In the present case, the strain comes not so much from a counter-literal attempt to deal with inherent ambiguity of words on their own, or from the need to cut back the meaning of open- ended words, but from the tension of counter-posing the broad words of limited application in section 241(8) with the narrower words of wide application in Chapter 3.

I accordingly do not apply the Venter principle as such, but rather what I consider to be the modern and appropriate judicial technique of proportionality. [126] I realise that the approach I am suggesting is relatively new in South Africa, and involves a utilization of proportionality that is a little different from its normal employment in other countries.   Yet I find it particularly helpful in dealing with cases such as the present.  [127] We are a new court, established in a new way, to deal with a new Constitution.  We should not rush to lay down sweeping and inflexible rules governing our mode of analysis.  We need to develop an appropriately South African way of dealing with our Constitution, one that starts with the Constitution itself, acknowledges the way it came into being, its language, spirit, style and inner logic, the interests it protects and the painful experiences it guards against, its place in the evolution of our country, our society and our legal system, and its existence as part of a global development of constitutionalism and human rights.  [128] It is a matter of public record that the approach of acknowledging problems and seeking consensual solutions based on a fair balance of interests, played a major role in the elaboration of the text of the Constitution; there seems to me no objection in principle to applying this approach to its intra-textual interpretation as well.  Although the two endeavours are quite different in nature, both are based on the notion of using a balanced approach to deal with competing interests, so that there are no outright winners and losers.36 [129] I might add that I regard the question of interpretation to be one to which there can never be an absolute and definitive answer and that, in particular, the search of where to locate ourselves on the literal/purposive continuum or how to balance out competing provisions, will always take the form of a principled judicial dialogue, in the first place between members of this court, then between our court and other courts, the legal profession, law schools, Parliament, and, indirectly, with the public at large.  [130] The objective of my approach in the present case is to preserve the essential functional core of section 241(8), while causing

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 37     Income Tax Special Purposes Commissioner v Pemsel (1891) AC 531 at 549 61 [138] There are circumstances of transition where a certain measure of incongruity and even injustice is inevitable.  In the present case, however, the incongruity flows not from the nature of the process itself, as contemplated by the framers, but from the mode of interpretation, as adopted by sections of the judiciary. [139] If one applies a strict literal test of section 241(8) on its own, and if one believes as Lord Halsbury did a century ago, that the lawmaker is an ideal person who never makes a mistake,37 then one might have no option but to accept that the framers actually intended the above consequences, in the sense of deliberately casting the linguistic net as wide as possible so as to cover all these situations. [140] Even accepting the less idealized vision which I am sure the framers of today would have of themselves, there could, of course, be circumstances where the only correct interpretation would be that section 241(8) must be taken to override Chapter 3.  These circumstances would include the situation where it is clear from the language and the context that the framers consciously adverted to and accepted such a necessity.  If this drastic consequence was manifestly the inevitable price of avoiding judicial disruption, then I could accept that the framers contemplated it, made their calculation and, if the expression is not too undignified, bit the constitutional bullet. [141] Yet it seems to me that there is no intrinsic reason why the functional objectives of avoiding unnecessary disruption to court proceedings cannot be harmonized with the fundamental rights of Chapter 3 and with the protective jurisdiction given to this court in Chapter 7.  Put another way, there is no reason why the mischief of disruption to the administration of justice should not be countered without producing the counter-mischief of nullification of the principles that lie at the heart of the constitution.  [142] In reality, the language of section 241(8) is open-ended rather than compelling on this score.  If the framers had intended a Constitution which in effect bit off its own leg, they would have developed a text that left no doubt of such a drastic intention.   [143] The issue in the present case cannot be reduced to one of deciding which interpretation gives rise to the greater or lesser number of anomalies.  Rather, we must discern which

Often police and judges have refused to  intervene, treated the situation lightly, or acted as if the batterer and the victim were  equally responsible, thus sending signals of legitimization to the abuser or blame to the  victim. . . . [T]he criminal justice system was designed when domestic violence was  considered off limits to state intervention.  Therefore, its structure is ill-adapted to  confronting this problem.  Together, outdated attitudes and inadequate institutional  structures have prevented the state from effectively dealing with the crime of domestic  abuse.” [Citation omitted]     15

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 45 According to Wills above n 11 at 174:  “Domestic violence is a societal, not merely an individual, problem; it is not just about  two people in a private relationship working out their ‘family problems’.  The harm  caused by this violence refuses to be neatly confined between the abuser and the victim.   Rather, domestic violence impacts everyone: children, neighbors, extended family, the  workplace, hospital emergency rooms, good samaritans who are killed while trying to  intervene, and the death row inmates who cite it as a reason not to be killed.  The state  has a legitimate interest in maintaining public safety, especially by ensuring that  domestic violence offenders are not allowed to flourish unabated.”     23

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 46 The Act is expressed in language that is not gender specific.  Clearly it applies to domestic violence of all  kinds, whether by husband to wife, or wife to husband.  Nevertheless in practice the complaints come  overwhelmingly from women who are abused by men.  I will follow international practice of referring to  the complainant as ‘she’ and the alleged violator as ‘he’.  Not only does this correspond to the statistical  norm, it also relates to the primary discriminatory social patterns addressed by the Act.  It should be  understood, however, that the Act protects all victims of domestic violence, whether male or female.   Indeed the appellant in this case sought and obtained an interdict against the complainant shortly after she  got an interdict against him.  Fedler points out at 232 (see above n 21) that in the first year of operation of  the Act, People Opposing Women Abuse (POWA), a non-governmental organisation specialising in the  protection of women’s rights, estimated that over 4800 women made use of its services.  POWA is only one  of a number of organisations in the Gauteng area that offer such services.  Other organisations include  Women Against Women Abuse (WAWA) in Eldorado Park, the Institute for Women’s Development  NISAA in Lenasia, Agisanang Domestic Abuse Prevention and Training (ADAPT) based at Alexandra  Health Clinic in Alexandra, and Lungelo at Chiawelo Clinic, Soweto.  All of these appear to be  organisations set up to protect battered women.  I am unaware of a need having been felt for the creation of  similar organisations for male victims of domestic violence.

It is inherently urgent, and although  intended to be formal, could well be considerably less formal than a trial.  Its function is to provide  immediate relief to the complainant without deciding on whether or not the accused should be found guilty  of the substantive offence.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 61 The possibility of this Court accepting the constitutionality of an intrusion on the right to silence in order to  promote a compelling public purpose, was envisaged by this Court in S v Mbatha; S v Prinsloo 1996 (2)  464 (CC); 1996 (3) BCLR 293 (CC).  In that case the issue was the impact not of an inquisitorial procedure  on the right to silence, but of a requirement on the accused to provide sufficient evidence to raise a  reasonable doubt as to guilt.  The principle, however, was the same.  Langa J, at para 26, said:  “That it might impact on the right of an accused person to remain silent is true; but on  the assumption that the rampant criminal abuse of lethal weapons in many parts of our  country would justify some measured re-thinking about time-honoured rules and  procedures, some limitation on the right to silence might be more defensible than the  present one on the presumption of innocence.  The accused could of course be exposed  to the risk of being convicted if he or she fails to offer an explanation which could  reasonably possibly be true, regarding physical association with the weapons; there  would however be no legal presumption overriding any doubts that the court might have.   At the end of the day and taking into account all the evidence, the court would still have  to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was indeed guilty.”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 57 The way English law approaches the development of the common law in this context is illustrated by,  for example, the decisions in Home Office v Dorset Yacht Co. Ltd [1970] AC 1004 (HL); Hill v Chief Constable  of West Yorkshire above n 34; Barrett v Enfield London Borough Council above n 35; and Lancashire County  Council and another v A (a child) [2000] AC 147 (HL).  By contrast the development of the private law in  Germany in the present context is through the indirect horizontal operation of the German Basic Law on private  legal relationships.  This so-called “radiating effect” of the Basic Law operates through the “general clauses” of  the German Civil Code, such as clauses which refer to “good morals,” “justified,” “wrongful,” “contra bonos  mores,” “good faith” and so forth; and could even operate in respect of private law rules which are unclear (see  Du Plessis and Others v De Klerk and Another, above n 15 at paras 39-40; 93-94; 103-05 and the authorities  referred to therein).

The Canadian Supreme Court has interpreted the concept "cruel and unusual punishment" as a "compendious expression of a norm" to which the relevant test was "whether the punishment prescribed is so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency."40   Factors to be taken into account in the assessment of the punishment included its effect, which must not be grossly disproportionate, the gravity of the offence, the personal characteristics of the offender and the particular circumstances of the case. According to Dickson CJ and Lamer J: " ... some punishments or treatments will always be grossly disproportionate and will always outrage our standards of decency: for example, the infliction of corporal punishment, such as the lash, irrespective of the number of lashes imposed ...

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 25 See the observations of Professor Hogg in Constitutional Law of Canada Vol 2, 5th Ed (Thomson Carswell,  Toronto 2007) at 52.2, who notes that: “The Supreme Court of Canada has occasionally exhibited a tendency to draw a rather romantic  picture of the eagerness of accused persons to be tried; Cory J., for example, has emphasized the  ‘exquisite agony’ of an accused awaiting trial.  It must be unpleasant to wait for a criminal trial,  but for an accused who is not in custody the wait may be preferable to the trial, with its risk of  conviction and sentence.  Since the burden of proof . . . is high, even the risk that witnesses may  disappear or forget is one that can sometimes be endured with fortitude.  It is only realistic to  accept that a speedy trial is not desired by many accused persons, and a court-ordered stay of  proceedings by reason of delay is a highly attractive windfall.”  (Footnote omitted.)

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 28 At the end of October 1994, Mr Sanderson was accused of sexually molesting two girls who, at the time, had been  standard five pupils at the school where he was employed as the deputy headmaster. On 1 December 1994, he  attended the office of the investigating officer, who informed him that he was suspected of acting in contravention of  the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957. After several postponements of the matter in court, the decision was made on  7 August 1995 to prosecute him on two charges under the Sexual Offences Act. However, no specific charges had  yet been formulated. The matter was subsequently set down for hearing in December 1995, but the trial was once  again postponed to 1 July 1996. After many requests, a charge-sheet was served on him only in May 1996. The  defence then applied for a trial date in October 1996. As certain witnesses were unavailable, the prosecution once  again postponed the matter to December 1996.  In November 1996, Mr Sanderson applied for a permanent stay of  prosecution.  The stay was granted by the High Court, which held, after balancing the right of Mr Sanderson to a  speedy trial against society’s interest, that there had been an unreasonable delay and undue social prejudice.  This  Court upheld the state’s appeal, finding no trial prejudice against Mr Sanderson had been established.

The following statistics are of relevance:  Fifty-five thousand rapes of women and girls are reported to the police  every year, which is estimated to be nine times lower than the actual number.  Thirty-nine percent of girls report  having undergone some form of sexual violence before they were eighteen.  Eighty-four percent of rapes in the  young age group are perpetrated by men who are known to the child, whether relatives, neighbours, friends, or  acquaintances (compare the fact that 52% of adult rapes are perpetrated by a non-stranger).  Exposure to trauma and  violence during childhood can give rise to both re-victimisation and intergenerational cycling of violence. Id at 1-5.  The report notes that “[r]evictimisation is a recognised occurrence in rape; girls exposed to sexual abuse as young  children are at increased risk of being raped again in childhood, and of experiencing intimate partner violence as  adults.”  Id at 3.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 52 Id at para 7.  Evidence presented to the Court explained that sexual abuse in terms of four trauma-inducing factors – traumatic sexualisation, betrayal, powerlessness and stigmatisation – distorted a child’s cognitive and emotional  relationship with the world.  At para 10, the Court stated: “Traumatic sexualisation is a process in which a child’s sexuality is developed and shaped  inappropriately and dysfunctionally at an interpersonal level.  Betrayal involves the discovery by a  child that someone on whom he or she is vitally dependent has caused the child harm.  It can be  experienced at the hands of an abuser or a family member who is unable or unwilling to protect or  believe the child or who has a changed attitude to the child after disclosure of the abuse.   Powerlessness develops through the repeated contravention of a child’s will, desires and sense of  efficacy.  It is reinforced when children see their attempts to halt the abuse frustrated, and is  increased by fear and an inability either to make adults understand or believe what is happening or  to realise how conditions of dependency have trapped them in the situation.  Stigmatisation  referred to the negative connotations – badness, shame, guilt – that are communicated to the child  and become incorporated into the child’s self-image”.

The brutal sexual violation  of a fellow being’s physical integrity, human dignity, security of person and psychological well- being to satisfy the assailant’s most primitive and bestial urges of lust, sexual domination and  power should not be tolerated in any society – least in ours, which has constitutionally committed  itself to the recognition and protection of the dignity, freedom and equality of all its members. Women, in general, have been the suffering prey of this crime for too long and too often.  Those  who have fallen victim to it have a legitimate expectation to seek just retribution against the  offenders though our judicial system. Moreover, as a class of persons constituting a significant  portion of society, women have the most immediate, compelling and direct interest that the courts  of this country should impose deterrent sentences to discourage potential offenders.

Notes taken by the Sexual Assault Crisis Centre during an interview with the complainant were  shredded by the organisation as a general policy to prevent the Centre from being subpoenaed to produce such  documents in criminal trials.  This behaviour narrowly divided the Canadian Supreme Court.  Stating that the  shredding of the documents was the factor that distinguished the case, the majority upheld the stay of prosecution

It remains the most important consideration  throughout the enquiry, bearing on the other considerations and, in turn, being coloured by them.   Furthermore, other than is the case in some comparable jurisdictions, no formal line is drawn in  our law between particular time spans regarded as acceptable and those that do not pass muster.   Our approach, rather, is to make a flexible evaluation of the time elapsed in the context of and in  conjunction with all other relevant features of the case, starting with the nature, gravity and extent  of the prejudice suffered, or likely to be suffered, by the accused.”  (Footnotes omitted.)

The starting point of any balancing enquiry  where constitutional rights are concerned must be that the public interest in ensuring that innocent  people are not convicted and subjected to ignominy and heavy sentences, massively outweighs the  public interest in ensuring that a particular criminal is brought to book.  Hence the presumption of  innocence, which serves not only to protect a particular individual on trial, but to maintain public  confidence in the enduring integrity and security of the legal system. Reference to the prevalence  and severity of a certain crime therefore does not add anything new or special to the balancing  exercise. The perniciousness of the offence is one of the givens, against which the presumption of  innocence is pitted from the beginning, not a new element to be put into the scales as part of a  justificatory balancing exercise.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 96 In the High Court, Mrs Bothma submitted a report of a criminologist, Dr Sonnekus, which set out to explain that  she had been inhibited through traumatic bonding with her assailant from making a complaint against him, and that  only counselling in the protected environment of prison had enabled her to acknowledge the manner in which the  repeated violations had affected her life and self-esteem.  The High Court rejected the report in its entirety,  regarding it as hearsay. In this Court Mrs Bothma made two applications, first to admit a supplementary affidavit and then to submit a  further supplementary affidavit.  The first application was made on 25 June 2009 and the second on 28 July 2009.   The supplementary affidavit sought to adduce facts regarding the reason for the time delay in instituting private  prosecution.  It dealt with the perceived culpability on the part of Mrs Bothma as found by the High Court, and also  contended further that Mrs Bothma would also suffer trial prejudice due to the long delay. The second supplementary affidavit included a report by, Mr Swanepoel, a psychiatrist, who gave his professional  opinion that Mrs Bothma presented psychological conditions consistent with those suffered by victims of childhood  sexual abuse, and that it was clinically well established that such victims may continue to hold themselves  responsible for having been violated for many years afterwards.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 9 Minister of Welfare and Population Development v Fitzpatrick and Others 2000 (3) SA 422 (CC); 2000 (7)  BCLR 713 (CC).  In that case British citizens permanently resident in South Africa, who expected to be  transferred to the United States of America, wished to adopt a South African-born child, Baby K.  To make this  possible they applied to the Cape High Court for an order declaring section 18(4)(f) of the Child Care Act  constitutionally invalid.  The High Court granted the order, but suspended it for two years to allow Parliament to  correct the defect.  The order of invalidity was then referred to this Court for confirmation, in terms of  sections 167(5) and 172(2)(a) of the Constitution.  Writing for a unanimous Court, Goldstone J held that  although the substance of the “best interests” principle had not been given exhaustive content in South African,  foreign or international jurisprudence, it was necessary that the standard be flexible because individual  circumstances determined which factors ensured the best interests of a particular child.  Since in certain  circumstances the best interests of a South African child could well be served by granting an order of adoption  in favour of non-nationals, the provision was unconstitutional.  He therefore confirmed the order of invalidity.

In the context of children’s rights, however, it has  a specialised meaning.  Unfortunately for our purposes very little guidance on the topic exists in the form of  foreign and international jurisprudence.  We were not referred to any case law directly in point.  See, however,  Pini and Others v Romania (2005) 40 EHRR 13 at para O-IV9 and J (AL) v M (SJ); ALJ v SJM and Others (1994) 98 BCLR (2d) 237 at paras 82-104 where respectively the European Court of Human Rights and the  British Columbian Supreme Court marginally touched upon this principle.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 20 The CRC (ratified by South Africa on 16 July 1995) and the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the  Child (acceded to by South Africa on 7 January 2000) require States parties to give effect to the principles of the  best interests of the child, subsidiarity and non-discrimination, and to establish safeguards to prevent child  trafficking and comity between States.  They also contain provisions recognising and protecting a child’s right  to a name, nationality and identity.  Article 21(b) of the CRC provides: “States parties that recognize and/or permit the system of adoption shall ensure that the best  interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration and they shall recognise that inter- country adoption may be considered as an alternative means of a child’s care, if the child  cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or cannot in any suitable manner be cared  for in the child’s country of origin”. Article 24(b) of the African Charter states: “States Parties which recognize the system of adoption shall ensure that the best interests of  the child shall be the paramount consideration and they shall recognize that inter-country  adoption in those States who have ratified or adhered to the International Convention on the  Rights of the Child or this Charter, may, as the last resort, be considered as an alternative  means of a child’s care, if the child cannot be placed in a foster or an adoptive family or  cannot in any suitable manner be cared for in the child’s country of origin”.

In the name of the child, everyone raises his or  her banner and simplifies the issues to the extreme, whereas, in this field, the rights of the  children concerned are not always so clear-cut and obvious.  The passions the topic unleashes,  in both countries of origin and receiving countries, distort information, confuse people’s  thinking and make action difficult and risky.  Often there is a tendency to consider only one  aspect of the problem, filtered through the prism of the side of the planet on which one lives.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 39 For example, it requires that a Contracting State designate a Central Authority tasked with fulfilling the duties  imposed by the Convention, and prescribes at what moment a child becomes adoptable and who is eligible to  adopt.  It establishes a regime of mutual aid between States ensuring that an adoption only takes place through  the co-operation of the receiving State, whose role it is to ensure that certain requirements have been met by the  prospective adoptive parents, and obliges receiving States to afford a minimum standard of local involvement by  following up on the well-being of the child after the adoption.  See articles 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 17 and 20.  Provision  is also made subject to safeguards for the accreditation by Contracting States of non-governmental organisations  to assist in achieving the objects of the Convention.  See articles 8-11.  Article 6 establishes Central Authorities,  whose duties, from a sending-country perspective, includes: establishing the adoptability of a child; matching  the child with the adoptive parents; deciding whether to place the child with the prospective adoptive parents;  procuring an adoption in the country of origin, if one is to be procured before transferring the child to the  receiving country; transferring the child to the receiving State; and, if it did not procure an adoption in the  country of origin, recognising one procured in the receiving country.

In similar vein, Duncan above n 16 at 221-2 states: “The principle of subsidiarity, while of central importance, should not be applied in an  inflexible manner.  There will sometimes occur cases where, in the interests of the child, a  placement with parents from abroad may be more appropriate than with prospective adopters  in the country where the child is resident, as for example where the child’s roots are in fact in  that foreign country.  Also it would be unfortunate if the principle were operated in a way  which led to excessive delay in the placement of a child, as for example by the adoption of  rigid administrative practices such as the imposition of quotas for foreign adoptions on placing  agencies.  It is important that the idea of subsidiarity be always interpreted and applied in the  context of the ‘best interests’ principle.”  (Footnote omitted.) The International Social Service “Intercountry Adoption: The Principle of Subsidiarity” Fact sheet No 36 (April, 2007) has pointed out that every matter— “should be studied individually, so as to devise a permanency plan, in line with the principle  of the child’s best interests.  Only a careful examination of each case, carried out preferably by  a group of professionals with varied training . . . should make it possible to take the  appropriate course of action.” Furthermore, sociological studies have shown that inter-country adoptions are largely successful and that  children who are adopted to foreign countries “remain proud of their ethnic, racial and national origins, happy in  their adoptive families and countries — and proud of themselves” and that they adjust well to their new  circumstances.

Certainly the mere fact that some parts of the world are materially richer than  others should not be seen as in itself justifying the transport of children to those countries.  At the same time one  has to take account of the fact that war, famine, natural disasters and endemic diseases frequently place  unbearable burdens on countries with scant resources.  Each case has to be looked at in the light of its own  particular circumstances.  To achieve a proper balance of all the considerations involved requires a maturity of  vision on the part of all of those involved, as well as the creation of specialised regulatory machinery.   Absolutist positions and mutual recriminations can only undermine the very principle at stake, namely, ensuring  that the best interests of the child are respected.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 59 Although in papers before this Court the Department expressly disavowed having ever placed a moratorium  on inter-country adoptions to the United States of America, it pointed out that it does not generally encourage  inter-country adoptions to that country, because it is not a party to the Hague Convention and there is no  working agreement in place between the United States and South Africa.  The United States signed the Hague  Convention on 31 March 1994 and passed implementing legislation, the Intercountry Adoption Act, which was  signed into law on 6 October 2000.  However, the final rules governing the accreditation of adoption agencies  were only issued on 15 February 2006, hence the Act was expected to come into force during this year.  The  Department claims that these factors make it more difficult to ensure safeguards against the risks that inter- country adoptions hold.  The Department’s attitude toward inter-country adoptions to the United States is that  such adoptions can in fact take place via the ordinary mechanism of the Children’s Court, but that they should  only take place with departmental oversight and only in exceptional circumstances.  The examples are where the  child has special needs, where the child is particularly hard to place within South Africa, where there is a long- standing pre-existing relationship between the adoptive parents and the child, or where the child is related to the  adoptive parents.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 67 Apart from the interviews with various senior officials in the Department, the report draws on direct  observations of Baby R and telephone interviews with the applicants.  It pointed out that the applicants had a  large family comparable to Baby R’s foster family; they were clearly concerned with imbuing in her the respect  they themselves had for what they regarded as their African roots; and they shared the religion, language and  culture of her foster parents.  Three comprehensive reports prepared by experienced social workers had  supported the view that they were an appropriate match for Baby R, and recommended permanent placement  with them.  Furthermore, they had been screened by an accredited agency in their State of residence, and the  affidavit of Ms Law, a practising attorney in the State of Virginia where Baby R was to be adopted, had  established that appropriate after-placement monitoring services would be carried out by a State-accredited  adoption agency.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 69 The curatrix had produced substantive material to enable the Children’s Court to deal swiftly with the matter.   She had gained a very favourable impression of the applicants.  Her report indicated that Baby R already spoke  with a distinct American accent.  The curatrix had added that the applicants had started making preparations for  Baby R’s arrival and had been devastated when the application in the High Court had been refused.   Subsequently they had been in contact with Baby R through frequent telephone conversations.  As in  Fitzpatrick, the presence of the bond established between the applicants and Baby R weighed heavily in favour  of their being considered worthy as adoptive parents.  The applicants were paradoxically a closer match to her in  terms of culture and religion than a local family would have been.  The report by the curatrix had also  established that the reliance placed by the Department on alternative permanent family placement in South  Africa had been somewhat misplaced.  As the amicus pointed out, however, child-care policy generally  discourages any pre-adoption bonding, which could be used as a device to favour certain would-be adoptive  parents, presenting child-care practitioners with a fait accompli.  The circumstances in the present matter,  however, were rather special.

The 25-minute hearing on Wednesday marked the end of a two- year legal battle in which the African-American couple sought to secure guardianship of  Baby R so they could adopt her in the US.”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 53 Reference was made to Telcordia above n 21 at para 86 which reads as follows: “Likewise, it is a fallacy to label a wrong interpretation of a contract, a wrong perception or  application of South African law, or an incorrect reliance on inadmissible evidence by the  arbitrator as a transgression of the limits of his power.  The power given to the arbitrator was  to interpret the agreement, rightly or wrongly; to determine the applicable law, rightly or  wrongly; and to determine what evidence was admissible, rightly or wrongly.  Errors of the  kind mentioned have nothing to do with him exceeding his powers; they are errors committed  within the scope of his mandate.  To illustrate, an arbitrator in a ‘normal’ local arbitration has  to apply South African law but if he errs in his understanding or application of local law the  parties have to live with it.  If such an error amounted to a transgression of his powers it  would mean that all errors of law are reviewable, which is absurd.”  (Footnote omitted.)

At page 5 of the decision the following statement appears: “There is no doubt that a voluntary waiver of court proceedings in favour of arbitration is in  principle acceptable from the point of view of Article 6 . . . Even so such a waiver should not  necessarily be considered to be a waiver of all rights under Article 6.” In the result, it was held, on the facts, that there had been an enforceable waiver of the right to challenge the  award on the basis of the alleged lack of impartiality of one of the arbitrators.

Stuprum violentum, translated as meaning “rape” by Hiemstra and Conin  above n 39, was distinguished as a form of seduction against the will of a woman.  It was regarded as closely  related to violent raptus and punished as such.  It would seem that the Roman-Dutch authorities treated the actus  reus of rape as a form of stuprum being one of a whole group of offences based on illicit sexual intercourse.   Stuprum was regarded as seduction or coition with women of certain classes but married women and prostitutes  were excluded.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 81 For instance, in the United Kingdom, the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 acknowledged that a  man could be a victim of rape and the definition of the actus reus was amended to cover vaginal or anal  intercourse against a woman or another man without his or her consent.  In 2003, a complete overhaul of the  rape legislation resulted in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 which defines the actus reus of rape as penile  penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth of another person without his or her consent.  In Canada, historically rape was defined in the Criminal Code of Canada as when a male has sexual intercourse  with a female who is not his wife without her consent, or when her consent is exhorted by threat or fear of  bodily harm, by impersonating her husband or by false and fraudulent representations as to the nature of the act.   In 1983, the offences of rape and indecent assault were conflated and redefined as sexual assaults.  The offences  are gender-neutral and a consent provision applies to all sexual and non-sexual types of assaults.  “Sexual  assault” was defined by the Supreme Court of Canada as “an assault . . . which is committed in circumstances of  a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated.”  R v Chase [1987] 2 SCR 293 at para 11.   The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the requisite sexual natures is an  objective one — viewed in the light of all circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible to  a reasonable observer?  In Australia, much like in the United Kingdom, the definition of rape has evolved significantly over the past  couple of decades.  Oral, vaginal and anal intercourses are all deemed by the Crimes Act to be sexual  intercourse.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 94 SW v United Kingdom; CR v United Kingdom (1995) 21 EHRR 363 at para 36/34 at 399.  The applicant in  SW, a United Kingdom citizen, was charged and convicted with the offence of raping his wife.  His conviction  was confirmed by the House of Lords.  He subsequently referred a complaint to the European Commission of  Human Rights, where he complained that in breach of Article 7(1) of the European Convention for the  Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms he was convicted in respect of conduct which at the  relevant time did not constitute an offence, breaching the principle of legality.  The case was ultimately decided  upon by the European Court of Human Rights in favour of the United Kingdom, unanimously holding that there  had been no violation of Article 7(1) of the Convention.  The factual circumstances in CR concerned a case of marital rape, where the wife had left the husband and had  returned to her parents’ home.  The husband forced his way into the home, assaulted and attempted to have  sexual intercourse with her against her will.  He was charged with attempted rape and assault occasioning actual  bodily harm.  He pleaded guilty and subsequently unsuccessfully appealed to the House of Lords.  The applicant  then referred a complaint to the European Commission of Human Rights.  The European Court of Human  Rights decided this case similarly to SW.   33

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 48 Under Australian law, no violation of the separation of powers doctrine occurs when compulsory minimum  sentences are set by the legislature leaving little or no discretion to the sentencing judge.  In the leading  case, Palling v Corfield (1970) 123 CLR 52, 58-9, it is made clear that prescribing penalties is solely in the  prerogative of the legislature, and no judicial discretion need be given.  See also Leask v Commonwealth of  Australia (1996) 140 ALR 1, 15.  In Wynbyne v Marshall (1997) 117 NTR 11, 26 (Sup Ct of the Northern  Territory) it was assumed that there was a restriction on the ability of the Legislative Assembly to pass laws  which require courts to impose punishments which are cruel or unusual, but that there was nothing cruel or  unusual in the requirement, imposed by the legislature, to record a conviction upon a finding of guilt and  impose a mandatory minimum sentence of the nature dealt with in that case.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 49 In Germany the independence of the judiciary and its separation from the other branches is well established  under articles 92 and 97 of the German Basic Law and includes the principle that “judicial power may be  exercised only by judges.”  See Currie “Separation of Powers in the Federal Republic of Germany” in  (1993) 41 The American Journal of Comparative Law 201, 249.  Article 104(2) of the Basic Law further  states that “only a judge may decide on the admissibility or continuation of detention”.  Sentencing  authority is thus central to the judicial function.  At the same time, the “Special Part” of the Strafgesetzbuch  (StGB) contains fairly detailed maximum and minimum sentences for various offences.  Thus the crimes of  murder (as defined in article 211) and genocide (as defined in article 220a) carry mandatory life sentences.   In the case of manslaughter, which does not constitute murder, article 212 prescribes a mandatory minimum  sentence of five years imprisonment.  Similar mandatory minimum sentences are prescribed, for example,  in certain circumstances for theft (article 242), fraud (article 263) and receiving stolen property (article  259).

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 50 Although Indian courts generally enjoy a wide discretion in imposing sentence, this is “canalised and  guided by law”.  See Kelkar Criminal Procedure 3 ed (Eastern Book Company, Lucknow 1993, with  supplement), 430.  The permissible range of sentence may be very narrow.  For instance, section 302 of the  Penal Code provides a minimum of a life sentence and the maximum of the death penalty in cases of  murder.  In Jagmohan Singh v State of Utar Pradesh (1973) 1 SCC 20 and Bachan Singh v State of Punjab  (1980) 2 SCC 684, it was argued, inter alia, that the lack of legislative guidelines to direct courts in  choosing between the two alternative punishments in section 302 amounted to an unlawful delegation of a  legislative function to the judiciary.  While this argument was rejected in both cases, all the justices in the  Bachan Singh case agreed that the imposition of standards tailoring the judicial discretion as to sentence  was a legitimate legislative function.  See paras 74-5 and para 77 of Bhagwati J’s dissent (separately  reported at (1982) 3 SCC 24).     31

See Hodge Doyle and Hodge’s Criminal Procedure in New Zealand 3 ed  (The Law Book Company Limited, Sydney 1991) 183.  Most notably, the Criminal Justice Act 1985  contains a set of comprehensive principles that “govern[ ] sentencing practice in New Zealand.”  See Casey  “Sentencing” in Thorndon et al (eds) The Laws of New Zealand Volume 25 (Butterworths, Wellington  1999), para 1.  In essence, these principles emphasise the imposition of custodial sentences for violent  crimes, while favouring alternative punishments for non-violent crimes.  See Doyle and Hodge 187.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 52 The Criminal Justice Act 1991 (as amended by the Criminal Justice Act 1993) contains the most  comprehensive attempt to influence judicial sentencing policy.  The Act steers clear of imposing strict  guidelines, but attempts to introduce broad principles to influence courts’ choices of sentence.  See Henham  Criminal Justice and Sentencing Policy (Dartmouth, Aldershot 1996) 9-10 and 131.  Sections 109-11 of the  Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 contains more specific provisions.  “Section 109 of the Act requires a court to pass a life sentence on an offender  who meets the conditions set out in section 109(1).  These are that he was 18  years or older when he committed the offence for which he is to be sentenced,  that this offence is a ‘serious offence’ as defined in subsection (5) committed  after September 30, 1997, and that he had been convicted of a ‘serious offence’  before he committed the offence for which he is to be sentenced.”  See Archbold Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice 2001, (Sweet & Maxwell, London 2001) 586.   Under section 109(2) the court is relieved from passing the mandatory life sentence only where it “is of the  opinion that there are exceptional circumstances relating to either of the offences or to the offender which  justify its not doing so.” (emphasis supplied)  Section 110 obliges a court sentencing an offender for a class  A drug trafficking offence to pass a minimum sentence of seven years if the offender is aged 18 or over and  has been convicted on at least two separate occasions of such an offence.  Section 111 mandates a  minimum sentence of three years for a third domestic burglary conviction.  Under sections 110 and 111 the  mandatory sentence can only be avoided where the court is of the opinion that there are “particular  circumstances which –  (a) relate to any of the offences or to the offender; and (b) would make it unjust to  do so in all the circumstances.”  (emphasis supplied)     32

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 25 See the observations of Professor Hogg in Constitutional Law of Canada Vol 2, 5th Ed (Thomson Carswell,  Toronto 2007) at 52.2, who notes that: “The Supreme Court of Canada has occasionally exhibited a tendency to draw a rather romantic  picture of the eagerness of accused persons to be tried; Cory J., for example, has emphasized the  ‘exquisite agony’ of an accused awaiting trial.  It must be unpleasant to wait for a criminal trial,  but for an accused who is not in custody the wait may be preferable to the trial, with its risk of  conviction and sentence.  Since the burden of proof . . . is high, even the risk that witnesses may  disappear or forget is one that can sometimes be endured with fortitude.  It is only realistic to  accept that a speedy trial is not desired by many accused persons, and a court-ordered stay of  proceedings by reason of delay is a highly attractive windfall.”  (Footnote omitted.)

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 28 At the end of October 1994, Mr Sanderson was accused of sexually molesting two girls who, at the time, had been  standard five pupils at the school where he was employed as the deputy headmaster. On 1 December 1994, he  attended the office of the investigating officer, who informed him that he was suspected of acting in contravention of  the Sexual Offences Act 23 of 1957. After several postponements of the matter in court, the decision was made on  7 August 1995 to prosecute him on two charges under the Sexual Offences Act. However, no specific charges had  yet been formulated. The matter was subsequently set down for hearing in December 1995, but the trial was once  again postponed to 1 July 1996. After many requests, a charge-sheet was served on him only in May 1996. The  defence then applied for a trial date in October 1996. As certain witnesses were unavailable, the prosecution once  again postponed the matter to December 1996.  In November 1996, Mr Sanderson applied for a permanent stay of  prosecution.  The stay was granted by the High Court, which held, after balancing the right of Mr Sanderson to a  speedy trial against society’s interest, that there had been an unreasonable delay and undue social prejudice.  This  Court upheld the state’s appeal, finding no trial prejudice against Mr Sanderson had been established.

The following statistics are of relevance:  Fifty-five thousand rapes of women and girls are reported to the police  every year, which is estimated to be nine times lower than the actual number.  Thirty-nine percent of girls report  having undergone some form of sexual violence before they were eighteen.  Eighty-four percent of rapes in the  young age group are perpetrated by men who are known to the child, whether relatives, neighbours, friends, or  acquaintances (compare the fact that 52% of adult rapes are perpetrated by a non-stranger).  Exposure to trauma and  violence during childhood can give rise to both re-victimisation and intergenerational cycling of violence. Id at 1-5.  The report notes that “[r]evictimisation is a recognised occurrence in rape; girls exposed to sexual abuse as young  children are at increased risk of being raped again in childhood, and of experiencing intimate partner violence as  adults.”  Id at 3.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 52 Id at para 7.  Evidence presented to the Court explained that sexual abuse in terms of four trauma-inducing factors – traumatic sexualisation, betrayal, powerlessness and stigmatisation – distorted a child’s cognitive and emotional  relationship with the world.  At para 10, the Court stated: “Traumatic sexualisation is a process in which a child’s sexuality is developed and shaped  inappropriately and dysfunctionally at an interpersonal level.  Betrayal involves the discovery by a  child that someone on whom he or she is vitally dependent has caused the child harm.  It can be  experienced at the hands of an abuser or a family member who is unable or unwilling to protect or  believe the child or who has a changed attitude to the child after disclosure of the abuse.   Powerlessness develops through the repeated contravention of a child’s will, desires and sense of  efficacy.  It is reinforced when children see their attempts to halt the abuse frustrated, and is  increased by fear and an inability either to make adults understand or believe what is happening or  to realise how conditions of dependency have trapped them in the situation.  Stigmatisation  referred to the negative connotations – badness, shame, guilt – that are communicated to the child  and become incorporated into the child’s self-image”.

The brutal sexual violation  of a fellow being’s physical integrity, human dignity, security of person and psychological well- being to satisfy the assailant’s most primitive and bestial urges of lust, sexual domination and  power should not be tolerated in any society – least in ours, which has constitutionally committed  itself to the recognition and protection of the dignity, freedom and equality of all its members. Women, in general, have been the suffering prey of this crime for too long and too often.  Those  who have fallen victim to it have a legitimate expectation to seek just retribution against the  offenders though our judicial system. Moreover, as a class of persons constituting a significant  portion of society, women have the most immediate, compelling and direct interest that the courts  of this country should impose deterrent sentences to discourage potential offenders. The  Namibian society shares those sentiments. . . .”

It remains the most important consideration  throughout the enquiry, bearing on the other considerations and, in turn, being coloured by them.   Furthermore, other than is the case in some comparable jurisdictions, no formal line is drawn in  our law between particular time spans regarded as acceptable and those that do not pass muster.   Our approach, rather, is to make a flexible evaluation of the time elapsed in the context of and in  conjunction with all other relevant features of the case, starting with the nature, gravity and extent  of the prejudice suffered, or likely to be suffered, by the accused.”  (Footnotes omitted.)

The starting point of any balancing enquiry  where constitutional rights are concerned must be that the public interest in ensuring that innocent  people are not convicted and subjected to ignominy and heavy sentences, massively outweighs the  public interest in ensuring that a particular criminal is brought to book.  Hence the presumption of  innocence, which serves not only to protect a particular individual on trial, but to maintain public  confidence in the enduring integrity and security of the legal system. Reference to the prevalence  and severity of a certain crime therefore does not add anything new or special to the balancing  exercise. The perniciousness of the offence is one of the givens, against which the presumption of  innocence is pitted from the beginning, not a new element to be put into the scales as part of a  justificatory balancing exercise.

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 96 In the High Court, Mrs Bothma submitted a report of a criminologist, Dr Sonnekus, which set out to explain that  she had been inhibited through traumatic bonding with her assailant from making a complaint against him, and that  only counselling in the protected environment of prison had enabled her to acknowledge the manner in which the  repeated violations had affected her life and self-esteem.  The High Court rejected the report in its entirety,  regarding it as hearsay. In this Court Mrs Bothma made two applications, first to admit a supplementary affidavit and then to submit a  further supplementary affidavit.  The first application was made on 25 June 2009 and the second on 28 July 2009.   The supplementary affidavit sought to adduce facts regarding the reason for the time delay in instituting private  prosecution.  It dealt with the perceived culpability on the part of Mrs Bothma as found by the High Court, and also  contended further that Mrs Bothma would also suffer trial prejudice due to the long delay. The second supplementary affidavit included a report by, Mr Swanepoel, a psychiatrist, who gave his professional  opinion that Mrs Bothma presented psychological conditions consistent with those suffered by victims of childhood  sexual abuse, and that it was clinically well established that such victims may continue to hold themselves  responsible for having been violated for many years afterwards.

That is so fundamentally important that the  discussion between the magistrate and the prosecutor in the instant case warranted on its own,  without anything more, the setting aside of the sentence.  Had such a discussion occurred  before conviction in this matter there can be no question but that the conviction would have  been fatally irregular: S v Seedat 1971 (1) SA 789 (N) at 792F.”

Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 53 Reference was made to Telcordia above n 21 at para 86 which reads as follows: “Likewise, it is a fallacy to label a wrong interpretation of a contract, a wrong perception or  application of South African law, or an incorrect reliance on inadmissible evidence by the  arbitrator as a transgression of the limits of his power.  The power given to the arbitrator was  to interpret the agreement, rightly or wrongly; to determine the applicable law, rightly or  wrongly; and to determine what evidence was admissible, rightly or wrongly.  Errors of the  kind mentioned have nothing to do with him exceeding his powers; they are errors committed  within the scope of his mandate.  To illustrate, an arbitrator in a ‘normal’ local arbitration has  to apply South African law but if he errs in his understanding or application of local law the  parties have to live with it.  If such an error amounted to a transgression of his powers it  would mean that all errors of law are reviewable, which is absurd.”  (Footnote omitted.)

At page 5 of the decision the following statement appears: “There is no doubt that a voluntary waiver of court proceedings in favour of arbitration is in  principle acceptable from the point of view of Article 6 . . . Even so such a waiver should not  necessarily be considered to be a waiver of all rights under Article 6.” In the result, it was held, on the facts, that there had been an enforceable waiver of the right to challenge the  award on the basis of the alleged lack of impartiality of one of the arbitrators.
