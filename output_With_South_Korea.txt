Citation String(text in FOOTNOTE) : 53 Reference was made to Telcordia above n 21 at para 86 which reads as follows: “Likewise, it is a fallacy to label a wrong interpretation of a contract, a wrong perception or  application of South African law, or an incorrect reliance on inadmissible evidence by the  arbitrator as a transgression of the limits of his power.  The power given to the arbitrator was  to interpret the agreement, rightly or wrongly; to determine the applicable law, rightly or  wrongly; and to determine what evidence was admissible, rightly or wrongly.  Errors of the  kind mentioned have nothing to do with him exceeding his powers; they are errors committed  within the scope of his mandate.  To illustrate, an arbitrator in a ‘normal’ local arbitration has  to apply South African law but if he errs in his understanding or application of local law the  parties have to live with it.  If such an error amounted to a transgression of his powers it  would mean that all errors of law are reviewable, which is absurd.”  (Footnote omitted.)
